# React Concepts Repository

## Introduction to React

Welcome to the React Concepts Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding core React concepts through a simple React application. Key concepts covered include:

- **Components:** React applications are built using components, which are reusable building blocks that combine to create complex user interfaces.
- **State:** React components can have state, representing data that can change over time. When the state of a component changes, the component re-renders to reflect the new state.
- **Props:** React components can receive props, which are data passed down from parent components. Props are used to configure the behavior of child components.
- **Lifecycle methods:** React components have lifecycle methods that are called at different stages of the component's lifecycle. These methods can be used to perform tasks such as fetching data, setting up event listeners, and cleaning up resources.
