# This repo covers important React Concepts

## Introduction to React

This repository contains a simple React application that demonstrates some of the core concepts of React, including:

* **Components:** React applications are built using components, which are reusable building blocks that can be combined to create complex user interfaces.
* **State:** React components can have state, which is data that can change over time. When the state of a component changes, the component will re-render itself.
* **Props:** React components can receive props, which are data that is passed down from parent components. Props are used to configure the behavior of child components.
* **Lifecycle methods:** React components have lifecycle methods that are called at different stages of the component's lifecycle. These methods can be used to perform tasks such as fetching data, setting up event listeners, and cleaning up resources.

## Getting started

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies: git clone https://github.com/57ajay/allreact
npm install
```

## Running the application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.


This will start a development server on port 3000. You can then open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 or other port if 5173 is busy to view the application.

## Code overview

The code for this application is located in the `src` directory. The main component of the application is the `App` component, which is defined in the `App.jsx` file. The `App` component renders two child components: a `UserProfile` component and a `Box` component.

The `UserProfile` component is a simple component that displays some information about a user, such as their name, age, and whether or not they are logged in. The `Box` component is a simple component that displays a colored box.
